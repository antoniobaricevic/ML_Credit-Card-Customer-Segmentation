# Machine Learning - Credit Card Customer Segmentation

Data analysis and ML models for Credit Card - Customer Segmentation - Clustering

1. KNN Model
2. Hierarchical Model

The KNN model was created with two approaches because the data set has a lot of outliers. First, with real data with all outliers because those outliers are in reality part of data. The second approach is with dropping part of the outliers, which I'm no fan of, but as part of an experiment in which the goal is to concentrate on the core of customers.
